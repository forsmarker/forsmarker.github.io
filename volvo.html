    We are travelling more and more. There is a lot of tools to use to get information about all the best places, restaurants, events and other things when you get to a new place. But still there’s always a thing missing and the most precious one: time!</p>
    <p>
        There is a lot of planning needed when travelling that takes a lot of time that most of us don’t have. From order a ticket, book a taxi to the airport, maybe rent a car to explore the city, go by expensive taxi journeys or to understand the ticket system of public transport in a new city and then find information about what to do there...</p>
    <p>
Renting a car and driving in a new city is a painful experience: you get lost, you don’t know the best way and you have to find a good parking space (that you also need to find again.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s not really the best option if you want to be effective and to experience a lot in a short period of time. Of course you can go by taxi, but you always tend to pay to much and it’s seriously a hassle. And then we didn’t even mention the safety-part.</p>

        The companion is a software developed to make every individual's day more easy and more environment friendly. By creating a cloud based profile where you add your favourite features it tailors your journey from point A to B. With the access to your profile and the internet it can easy help you with whatever you need. </p>

We’re giving the customer the personalized experience of riding a Volvo. It raises the customer's curiosity and interest about the brand. By doing that, marketing will not be of the same value for Volvo because it will be more of a self-marketing strategy.
