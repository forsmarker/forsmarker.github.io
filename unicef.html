        <h3>COfficef</h3>
Coffee, an everyday delight! The elixir of our endeavours and sooth- ing balm in the urban strife. It invigorates even the most fatigued bodies. And bring warmth to even the coldest Scandinavian souls.</p>
    <p>
       We needed a way to engage teachers with #operationdagsverke, but teachers are busy people, so as the sociable and coffee-consuming beings they are, we figured out that Instead of contacting one person per school we would try to start a dialogue between them while they gather some new energy.</p>
    <p>
<h3>HOW</h3>
As a response to this daily life habit, we’ll create aninteractive expe- rience that follows seven steps:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Send secret unicef designed mugs to teachers in schools all around the country. On these cup we’ve printed a unicef link as well as a hashtag that doesn’t make any sense at all.. For now ..This will create a fun and curious attitude towards these mysterious mugs.</p>
    <p>
        2. The teachers will notice the link and enter the website. </p>
    <p>
3. An eye-opening video of a teacher in another part of the world holding the same cup will explain how the efforts of operation dagsverke has helped their country, this will create an eyeopener human rights interactive experience that wants to make the teacher more sensitive to the cause.
    </p>
        <p>
4. An invitation to share the swedish teachers own experience is going to appear, linked to the hashtag
“cofficef”
    </p>    <p>
5. The teacher has the option to share their own “cofficef” post on social medias
    </p>    <p>
6, By using social media technologies all the posts will automatically be vinculated and will show on the official cofficef website.
    </p>
    <p>
7. Last but not least, the teachers will naturally feel compelled to sign up and participate in Operation Dagsverke, making the world a better place through everyones shared efforts.
Drink with the world. Cofficef.
