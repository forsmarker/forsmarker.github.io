    Collect STHLM is a solution made to motivate the conscious urban citizen to choose the public transportation.</p>
    <p>
       We implement a scoring system that benefits the user by rewarding them in points. The more you travel – the more you benefit from it. For each time you register a travel you get points. There are different points for different timetables, motivating the travellers to use the system not only during rush hours but also during all hours accessible, creating a smoother flow in the system. In case of delay, you receive compensating points for each ten minutes, reprogramming the users experience from negative to positive.
</p>
    <p>
The points you collect by each travel gives you a wide offer of discounts. We have a wide range of partners such as coffee shops, entertainment companies and other services filling the needs of our costumers. Not only motivating our travellers to travel by public transport, but also stimulating the economy of businesses around Stockholm.
    </p>
    <p>
       For example; commute your way to any of our partner museums and use your points to get a discount. While traveling there you collect even more points that can be used as discount the next time you will buy your SL card. If you have enough points and ride our means of transportation at a high rate they can also access our membership Wi-Fi.</p>
    <p>
        We also have a plan for Collect STHLM to be in the forefront of CSR. You can through Collect STHLM use your points to plant a tree in one of energy forests. These forests are providing us with the fuel needed to drive our eco friendly vehicles. We are now creating a social ecosystem where the traveller contributes, and becomes a part of the fuel to our engines. If a traveller plants a tree they are also rewarded with a green membership, a discount to encourage conscious thinking. </p>
    <p>
It is operated and used through an app. The user simply registers a card to an account to get an overview of the scores and offers. The app also has other features, for the entertainment of the client. We bring life to ads through augmented reality where information or entertainment can take place, the next generation of interactive advertising. In the app you also find a customer service feature, where you can chat with staff, leave opinions or get information. Of course we also have real-time schedules, journey planning and all the features you need for a smooth experience.
    </p>
    <p>This is the modern and sophisticated solution for the conscious urban citizen. It is simple, convenient and sustainable. A society-hack, created with a feasible solution that can be implemented anywhere, anytime and under any circumstances. We create a rewarding system, motivating the traveller not only to use the public transport because it’s good for the world, but because it’s good for them.</p>
