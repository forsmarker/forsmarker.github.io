This is an interactive campaign, where the content is user created by uploading selfies to digital ad boards around the city landscape and creating a chain of pictures, travelling around to different places. A heart shaped filter would be provided to frame the selfie and also tie the activities together with the theme of the Eurovision. 

The solution could be implemented as a feature in the current Eurovision mobile app or as a browser based feature, at the song contestÂ´ offical website.
